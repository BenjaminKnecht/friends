Contact management system

friends is a simple contact management system with which you can easily manage your friends, acquaintances, work collegues and similar contacts. The system will remember who you have neglected in the past and remind you to get back in contact with them. You can organize events and invite these friends automatically. It will also make suggestions who to invite to your planned events.

The system is written as a Ruby on Rails application and is supposed to run on a personal webserver so your contact list can be reached from everywhere.
